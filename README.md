For the character, she's a Tiefling who had her heart replaced with an engine that causes her heart to heat and overheat as a result. Her core storyline is about finding a way to fix this engine which is not used to the climate of the area where the player and companions are traveling in.

All of the conversational quips within the menu are from voice lines in the game, and the name of the deli itself is also a tribute to one of her common nicknames for the player, "soldier".
